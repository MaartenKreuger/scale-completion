# scale-completion
Spectrum Scale bash command line completion

written for Scale version 5.0.4+, will mostly work for older versions too.

this project contains one completion file for each gpfs command, and one general functions file. All files should be copied to the /etc/bash_ompletion.d folder for all users in the system, or in the ~/.bash_completion folder per user.
